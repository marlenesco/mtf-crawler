Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/Gqb_-IIN_AM Tags: 3dprint , siraya , strength test , tenacious , material test , Few months ago, I compared Siraya Blu-Tenacious mix vs ABS materials as 3rd match SLA vs FDM 3D printed bolts and nuts. In this video I would like to test Siraya resins separately and as 50-50% mixture. Used test specimens have same dimensions as those in my previous videos, so results are comparable with each other.
