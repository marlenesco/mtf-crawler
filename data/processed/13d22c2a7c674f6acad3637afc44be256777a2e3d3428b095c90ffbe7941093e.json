Engineering PLA and PLA advanced by Filaticum Title: Best PLA for mechanical parts? Engineering PLA and PLA advanced by Filaticum. Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/uF2_ceBQ40Y Tags: 3dprint , filaticum , material test , This is the test of two very interesting materials, best PLA for mechanical parts I tested so far. Engineering PLA has great impact resistance and it starts to deform on temperatures near 150°C. The layer adhesion could be a little bit better. Advanced PLA has great layer adhesion and it should be more resistance to high temperatures compared to regular PLA.
