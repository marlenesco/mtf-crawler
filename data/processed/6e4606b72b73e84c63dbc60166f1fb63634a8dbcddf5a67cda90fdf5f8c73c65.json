Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/H_3SPwlUv5Y Tags: 3dprint , material test , bambulab , petcf , BambuLab PET-CF is a filament reinforced with carbon fibers, the base is PET (like PET bottles, no Glycol, like in PETG filaments). Test objects are printed with X1C 3D printer using default settings in Bambu Studio. I am repeating same mechanical testings, so the results are comparable with those from my earlier experiments. Since in this video I have only PET-CF for the testing, in the results part I am including the PPA-CF values.
