Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/8rjUzWZ0w78 Tags: 3dprint , strength test , material test , cnc machining , pcbway , I was curious how much weaker is 3D printed material compared to PEEK, POM, Brass or Aluminum. So when PCBWay asked me to introduce their CNC machining services in any of my videos in exchange for sponsoring, I told them instead sponsoring, they could manufacture these test objects for me, and I will do a dedicated video for free. For reference material I used 3D printed ABS. PCBWay website: https://www.pcbway.com/ Earlier I introduced their 3D printing services too: https://youtu.be/aRReSg76RuA Results can be downloaded below this text.
