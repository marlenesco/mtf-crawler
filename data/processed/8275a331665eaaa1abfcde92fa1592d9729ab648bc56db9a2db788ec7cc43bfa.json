Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/w1XqOZsFPrY Tags: 3dprint , cnc , strength test , material test , Few months ago I presented PCBWAY metal (SLM) 3D printing services. It was a pleasant surprise, how strong are those parts. Horizontally and vertically printed objects had similar strength. So, the obvious question was, how they preform compared to CNC machined objects? Let's find out.. Same test objects are CNC machined and 3D printed from aluminum and from stainless steel.
