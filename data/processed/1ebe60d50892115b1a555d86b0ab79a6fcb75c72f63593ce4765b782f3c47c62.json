Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/uqewyYVed0o Tags: 3dprint , esun , material test , eSun PLA-HS high speed filament (old name HF, means high flow) is designed to be used on higher 3D printing speeds. Product page: https://www.esun3d.com/epla-hf-product/ PLA+: https://www.esun3d.com/pla-pro-product/ Kingroon KP3S, klipper based 3D printer was used, which is able to print on high speeds, but one important thing has to be mentioned, it was equipped with hardened steel nozzle (which I noticed later), resulting weaker layer adhesion.
