Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/9RcGLnCj0Y8 Tags: 3dprint , filaticum , material test , A month ago I was visiting 3D printing companies on Hungexpo and there Filaticum company introduced me their filaments. In this video I am testing Filaticum Model and Foam filaments. Model contains gypsum, which makes it interesting for modellers. Foam expands on higher temperatures and by reducing the flow rate, we can get very light objects with foamed, spongy surface.
