Title: Big wearing test, which filament type is the most wear resistant?. Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/Vg-FcCrVrZY Tags: 3dprint , material test , Let's find out, which filament type is the most wear resistant (in friction with the metal). Tested material types: PLA, PETG, ABS, ASA, PC (PolyCarbonate), Nylon and TPU. Effect of the carbon fibres to the wearing is also tested. Hopefully, there will be a scientific article, the link will be included here.
