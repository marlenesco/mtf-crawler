Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/cQb-hbr1KYY Tags: 3dprint , polymaker , material test , nylon filament , Polymaker PolyMide filament line is great for many functional parts, but it is important to understand their possibilities and when to use them. The printability is great, the warp-free technology gives the possibility to use them on open printer, but using of a hardened nozzle and a filament dryer is recommended. Glass- or carbon fibers gives not only great mechanical properties to these PA materials, but also a great surface quality. https://us.polymaker.com/collections/nylon?aff=49 Results can be downloaded from: https://www.mytechfun.com/video/238 All Polymaker related videos: https://www.mytechfun.com/videos/polymaker Contents: 0:00 Introduction 2:50 CoPA 3D printing 6:33 PA6-GF 3D printing 9:36 PA6-CF 3D printing 11:06 Testing with timing belt 12:31 PA12-CF 3D printing 14:03 Before mechanical testing 15:30 Tensile (pulling) test 16:18 Layer adhesion test 17:33 Shear stress 18:15 Torque (twist) test 19:37 IZOD impact test 20:51 Temperature test 22:21 C-bending creep test 23:59 Screw (compression) test 25:44 New bending test 28:06 Results 31:23 Conclusion #polymaker #nylon #3dprinting Download files: polymaker-pa-nylon.xlsx 368.6 kB",
