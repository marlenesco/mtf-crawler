Title: LW-PLA vs LW-ASA by Colorfabb, which one is stronger?. Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/24jSxUJ0AT0 Tags: 3dprint , colorfabb , strength test , material test , LightWeight (LW) filaments are designed for RC planes or modelling, where you need same volume but with reduced weight. These filaments can change the density in function of the temperature. On higher temperatures volume increases thanks to the foaming, so to keep the same volume, flow rate must be reduced. The foaming effect increases the volume but also strength will be reduced. This is a comparison video to find out how strong are LW-PLA and LW-ASA filaments from Colorfabb.
