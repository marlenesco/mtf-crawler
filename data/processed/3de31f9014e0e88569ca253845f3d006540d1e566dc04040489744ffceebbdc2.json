Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/EAomawFGWBs Tags: 3dprint , material test , With pendulum impact testing machine, we can see how the material resists to dynamic loads. The cost of DIY impact testing machine was 60$, but the main problem with it is the geometry of the hammer. I bought an analog impact tester from eBay; the cost is 15x bigger than DIY but 15x cheaper compared to European machines. Looks like 5.5J is too strong for 3D printing materials, but there are many other questions too. Is it usable? What is the accuracy? Is it finished? To be honest, it reminds me to Ender-3, which can be accurate 3D printer, but it needs some tinkering.
