Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/mrp28hZ_Qu0 Tags: 3dprint , strength test , material test , jlcpcb , 3d printing services , In this video I want to find out how strong is SLM 3D printed metal (316L stainless steel) and I will compare it with FDM printed ABS. SLM printers are expensive, that's why it is good to have affordable source for 3D printing services. JLCPCB primary services is PCB manufacturing, but they also have 3D printing services. https://jlcpcb.com/3d-printing Results in Excel download below this page.
