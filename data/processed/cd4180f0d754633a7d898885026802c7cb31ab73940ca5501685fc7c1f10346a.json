Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/7r16-UDo2t4 Tags: 3dprint , siraya , fdm vs sla , strength test , sla 3d printing , material test , In first experiment FDM vs SLA I used the most popular and budget materials, like Elegoo Water Washable Photopolymer resin and PLA filament. A lot of comments suggested that I should use better materials, like PETG and Siraya Blu. Few weeks after that video Siraya Tech company contacted me and they sent me Siraya Blu resin for a review. So in this video I am comparing Siraya Blu and PETG 3D printed bolts and screw nuts. Bolts are M6x20. PETG material: Prusament PETG orange printed on Prusa MK3s Siraya Blu printed on Elegoo Mars and Photon S. https://siraya.tech/ The previous FDM vs SLA video: https://youtu.be/k5xxZKv7IRg Results can be seen on end of each test.
