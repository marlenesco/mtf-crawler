Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/aRReSg76RuA Tags: 3dprint , strength test , material test , fdm vs sla , pcbway , This is another filament vs resin 3D printing material comparison. PCBWay contacted me, that they would like to sponsor my video to introduce their 3D printing services. A great solution for those, who don't have a 3D printer or who needs something what is not possible to print on their own printer. I have those test specimens I am using regularly in other videos. When PCBWay asked me to reduce the number of test objects, I decided to do this video for free, but every type of test specimen must be included. https://www.pcbway.com/rapid-prototyping/manufacture/?type=2&reffercode=TOP Contents: 0:00 Introduction 1:30 Ordering process 3:16 Unboxing 3:41 Dimensional accuracy 6:59 Layer adhesion test 7:40 Tensile strength 8:10 Shear test 8:59 Bending test 9:32 Impact test 10:27 Twist test 11:39 Results 13:51 Conclusions #3dprintingservices #pcbway #polycarbonate #performresin Download files: No downloadable files for this video.",
