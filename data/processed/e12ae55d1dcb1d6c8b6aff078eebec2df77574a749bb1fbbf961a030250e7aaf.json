Title: eSUN ABS+ vs ASA filament test, which one is stronger from mechanical strength aspect?. Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/O9QmfDy9HmA Tags: 3dprint , esun , strength test , material test , eASA vs ABS+ tested from mechanical strength aspect (including hardness, creep- and temperature tests). Earlier I already tested ePA, ePC and ABS+ filaments by eSun, in that video I used ABS+ in white color, but some comments suggested to test black ABS+ too, so I bought it myself. The eASA filament is also in black color and it was sent to me by eSun. ABS+: https://esun3dstore.com/collections/3d-printing-filament/products/esun-abs eASA: https://www.esun3d.com/easa-product/ List of all eSun related videos: https://www.mytechfun.com/videos/esun Results can be downloaded below this text.
