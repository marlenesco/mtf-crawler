Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/2eMKx1d8Jjo Tags: 3dprint , siraya , fdm vs sla , strength test , sla 3d printing , material test , This is just small additional info to my previous video (Siraya Blu vs PETG 3D printed bolts and nuts). Several comments asked me to test those bolts after temperature test. This is just a preliminary test, to see is it worth it to do some additional experiments in this topic. Results just confused me, so far I don't plan to do more tests based on this.
