Title: Sunlu Easy ABS: easy for 3D printing, no odor, but what about mechanical properties?. Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/-WL_Ue0fIfM Tags: 3dprint , abs , sunlu , material test , Sunlu Easy ABS is a new product which is very easy for 3D printing, don't have irritating odor, lower print temperature. Some mechanical properties are lower compared to average ABS material, including the creeping and the impact resistance (but still better than average PETG). Overall, great filament, only that temperature resistance could be better. Sunlu filaments (affiliate link): https://bit.ly/43d0aaY Results: download below this text.
