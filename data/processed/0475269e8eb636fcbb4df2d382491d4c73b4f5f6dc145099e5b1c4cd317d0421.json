Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/JpTSzpRQ_T4 Tags: 3dprint , siraya , fdm vs sla , strength test , sla 3d printing , tenacious , material test , This video is a 3rd match of FDM vs SLA 3D printed bolts and screw nuts and in this comparison I am using SUNLU ABS vs Siraya Tenacious and Blu mix 50-50%. I will repeat all those experiments from 2nd match (tensile-, shear- and torque test) including impact and temperature tests too.
