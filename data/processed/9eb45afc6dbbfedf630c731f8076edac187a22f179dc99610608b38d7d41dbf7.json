Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/qB3tgEEDTyc Tags: 3dprint , filamentum , material test , strength test , Nonoilen filament by Filamentum may be another solution for food safe 3D printing. Since I work on Food Engineering Department (at uni-mate.hu) and I am trying to implement 3D printing in my workplace, it is very important to find solution, where 3D printed object can have direct contact with the food. So far, I tested coating with epoxy resin, smoothing the object, using antibacterial filaments etc. Nonoilen filament may survive 110°C, this means object can be placed in boiling water or in dishwasher on high temperatures. The printability of this material is similar like PLA. I also did some mechanical tests too, since manufacturer claims, that this is tough material. There is one error in video, unit of bacterial test is CFU and not CFU/cm2, but the ratio between two tests is correct.
