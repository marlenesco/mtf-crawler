Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/TUKXkWP24ek Tags: 3dprint , addnorth , petg , material test , I tested two PETG filaments from AddNorth: Rigid X and regular PETG. Rigid X stands out as the stiffest PETG filament I've ever worked with, offering properties similar to ABS, including impressive temperature resistance. It's a fantastic alternative for those without an enclosed 3D printer who still want durable, high-performance prints.

By Siraya Tech Title: PET-CF, technical filament with best strength to price ratio. By Siraya Tech. Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/Y7npttLpcO0 Tags: 3dprint , material test , petcf , siraya , Discover the true potential of Siraya Tech's glass fiber-reinforced filaments as I compare ABS-GF and ASA-GF in a detailed 3D printing performance test. These specialized materials promise enhanced strength, reduced shrinkage, and better heat resistance\u2014but how do they really perform? In this video, I explore everything from unboxing to hands-on 3D printing and real-world stress tests. I evaluate key aspects like layer adhesion, tensile strength, impact resistance, and more. I even dive into thermal performance and long-term creep behavior to see which filament is the ultimate choice for demanding applications. Whether you're a maker, engineer, or hobbyist, this comprehensive review will help you decide which filament suits your needs.

I bought an analog impact tester from eBay; the cost is 15x bigger than DIY but 15x cheaper compared to European machines.

Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/uF2_ceBQ40Y Tags: 3dprint , filaticum , material test , This is the test of two very interesting materials, best PLA for mechanical parts I tested so far. Engineering PLA has great impact resistance and it starts to deform on temperatures near 150\u00b0C. The layer adhesion could be a little bit better. Advanced PLA has great layer adhesion and it should be more resistance to high temperatures compared to regular PLA.

Title: LW-PLA vs LW-ASA by Colorfabb, which one is stronger?. Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/24jSxUJ0AT0 Tags: 3dprint , colorfabb , strength test , material test , LightWeight (LW) filaments are designed for RC planes or modelling, where you need same volume but with reduced weight. These filaments can change the density in function of the temperature. On higher temperatures volume increases thanks to the foaming, so to keep the same volume, flow rate must be reduced. The foaming effect increases the volume but also strength will be reduced. This is a comparison video to find out how strong are LW-PLA and LW-ASA filaments from Colorfabb.

Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/qB3tgEEDTyc Tags: 3dprint , filamentum , material test , strength test , Nonoilen filament by Filamentum may be another solution for food safe 3D printing. Since I work on Food Engineering Department (at uni-mate.hu) and I am trying to implement 3D printing in my workplace, it is very important to find solution, where 3D printed object can have direct contact with the food. So far, I tested coating with epoxy resin, smoothing the object, using antibacterial filaments etc. Nonoilen filament may survive 110\u00b0C, this means object can be placed in boiling water or in dishwasher on high temperatures. The printability of this material is similar like PLA. I also did some mechanical tests too, since manufacturer claims, that this is tough material. There is one error in video, unit of bacterial test is CFU and not CFU/cm2, but the ratio between two tests is correct.

ASA (Acrylic Styrene Acrylonitrile) is a technical material that is considered a successor to ABS. ASA is UV resistant and has higher heat deflection temperatures, but it is harder for printing, it requires higher temperatures, brim and some enclosure.

Watch on youtube: https://youtu.be/DcWiA-sqPnI Tags: 3dprint , food safe , polysmooth , polymaker , material test , Half years ago I created a video where I was talking about food safe 3D printing. One of the test probes was cup 3D printed from Polysmooth\u2122 from Polymaker\u2122. It can be smoothed using isopropyl alcohol. I couldn't find any food grade certificate on the box, but I needed it only to see if smoothing the surface can result easier cleaning after direct contact with food. I smoothed the cup from Polysmooth using a brush, but smoothing was far from perfect and surface become very sticky and it perform very badly on the bacterial test. Few weeks later I was contacted by Polymaker, because my method is not correct, they can provide me PolyBox\u2122 and Polysher\u2122 so I can get more relevant results. They also mention that they have certificate for PVB, the main material in this filament and also for transparent version of the Polysmooth filament. Test was repeated with cups prepared by Polymaker, and they perform much better on bacterial test, but far from perfect, not comparable with Injection Molded or coated with Epoxy resin. Test was prepared in cooperation with University of Novi Sad, Serbia, Department of Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Engineering.
